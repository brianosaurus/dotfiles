2015-09-02 09:53:42	@petong	sup gage!
2015-09-02 09:55:27	@gage	the movers gave us a 10-day window of when our stuff would arrive, with 1 day advance notice. finally they are coming today on day 9, at the same time that i have a technical inteview including coding on screen share. whee!
2015-09-02 09:56:09	@petong	perfect timing!
2015-09-02 09:56:14	@gage	yeah really
2015-09-02 09:56:30	@gage	but at least we finally get our stuff. been living out of a suitcase for the past two weeks.

2015-09-02 09:57:18	@gage	it's small, but pretty awesome. really weird to be in our own house with a yard and stuff.
2015-09-02 09:57:44	@gage	and it has modern amenities like a stove and fridge not from the 80s which kinda blow my mind
2015-09-02 09:57:57	@gage	the yard is huge and has blueberries, blackberries, grape vines, etc
2015-09-02 09:58:04	@petong	nice
2015-09-02 09:58:34	@gage	we have way too much furniture for this place, heh
2015-09-02 09:58:39	@gage	good motivation to buy a house asap
2015-09-02 09:58:57	@gage	luckily we have a big garage to store the excess in

2015-09-16 13:14:08	@petong	how is fred? haven't seen him in a few weeks
2015-09-16 13:14:49	bbrian	Seems good.  Because of Dreamforce I was trying to hurry through the crowds. 
2015-09-16 13:14:55	bbrian	Reminds me: http://www.marketwatch.com/story/salesforce-hails-cruise-ship-after-conference-dries-up-sf-hotel-space-2015-09-14
2015-09-16 13:15:15	@petong	I was wondering what that big ass cruise ship was doing there
2015-09-16 13:16:45	bbrian	160,000 people in the city this week
2015-09-16 13:16:49	bbrian	extra people

2015-09-16 15:58:13	@bang	unless I want to go to eureka. yee!
2015-09-16 16:13:37	brianosau	I did some googling.  The city normally swells by 160k people in the day normally so this would be double the swell.  
2015-09-16 16:19:42	@reshippie	ew
2015-09-16 16:19:55	@reshippie	1 of the reasons I like working on the penninsula
2015-09-16 16:26:38	@bang	it felt kinda dead around embarcadero today. didn't head toward moscone at lunch
2015-09-16 16:28:27	brianosau	Around here there are lots of people that have their salesforce backpacks with their salesforce water bottles and salesforce neck badges.  More so at Equinix gym.  
2015-09-16 16:31:00	ivanna	so much salesforcing :(
2015-09-16 16:31:32	ivanna	i was at the target earlier and wanted to get lunch omg lines everywhere
2015-09-16 16:33:25	ivanna	does anyone know anything about fixing dents in a hardwood floor?
2015-09-16 16:34:11	@bang	ouch. does not sound like that will buff out
2015-09-16 16:35:22	@reshippie	ivanna: put a wet cloth over it, then apply heat to the cloth
2015-09-16 16:35:26	@reshippie	like with an iron
2015-09-16 16:35:42	@reshippie	basically, make it hot and wet to get the wood to rise a little
2015-09-16 16:35:53	@reshippie	depends on how deep the dent is
2015-09-16 16:36:01	@reshippie	few mm and it should work
2015-09-16 16:36:08	@reshippie	careful you don't ruin the finish
2015-09-16 16:36:41	ivanna	wow, i didn't know that was possible!
2015-09-16 16:37:36	@reshippie	yep
2015-09-16 16:37:54	ivanna	i don't mind the scratches, but the dents are annoying cause i walk over it with my bare feet and feel them and remind me of them :(
2015-09-16 16:38:26	@reshippie	heh
2015-09-16 16:38:45	@reshippie	i have a big one in my living room, but too deep to steam away
2015-09-16 16:38:53	@reshippie	speaker fell on it's corner
2015-09-16 16:39:20	ivanna	my poor floor's been abused from all my airbnb tenants :(
2015-09-16 16:39:44	@reshippie	ugh, I can only imagine
2015-09-16 16:40:06	@reshippie	though, probably not as bad as dog + cat + 4yo boy
2015-09-16 16:40:27	ivanna	there are these dents where it's pretty clear someone was rocking a chair there
2015-09-16 16:40:48	ivanna	and, thus explains why one of my chairs is broken too hehe
2015-09-16 16:41:55	brianosau	my wife won't let us AirBnB...maybe that's a good decision.  However, if we did we could essentially take vacations for free.
2015-09-16 16:42:06	@petong	VRBO
2015-09-16 16:42:12	@reshippie	and that's why we pay someone to watch our house when we're away
2015-09-16 16:42:18	@reshippie	instead of letting someone pay us
2015-09-16 16:42:18	@petong	everyone wants to come to SF
2015-09-16 16:42:32	@petong	just switch with someone
2015-09-16 16:42:52	@reshippie	they also take care of dog and cat
2015-09-16 16:43:49	ivanna	airbnb is pretty much a hotel system now, less mom/pop and less b&b-y
2015-09-16 16:44:16	ivanna	the last few airbnb places i didn't even meet my host, it was clear they were running the apartments for profit and not living there
2015-09-16 16:44:55	ivanna	but maybe switching places with another airbnb host may be worthwhile since they know how to take care of their own place too (hopefully!)
2015-09-16 16:45:11	ivanna	omg it's raining, yes, rain on the salesforces!

2015-09-18 10:44:03	brianosau	The salesforce people are wandering around all looking hung over.  Their big party was last night
2015-09-18 10:44:22	brianosau	Foo Fighters, Duran Duran, The Killers...free *everything*, all you can eat and drink. 
2015-09-18 10:48:17	brianosau	Our 26 year old CEO (who is recently single) said the salesforce parties 'suck but the chicks are hot.' 
2015-09-18 10:51:43	theo	the party did suck. it was at pier 70. it was fully packed and only 5% of the people could watch the bands. everyone else had to watch on monitors. 
2015-09-18 10:51:48	theo	anyone want a pass for today?
2015-09-18 10:52:43	brianosau	how was the food?  
2015-09-18 10:53:08	theo	ok.

2015-09-28 11:10:57	@gage	my tv has started doing this freakout thing where it shows a really fucked up display sometimes, like vertical lines or weird static plasma patterns. avsforum says there may be a badly seated connector inside. i'm not really excited to take it apart, but i'd feel lame buying a new tv without even trying to fix it :P
2015-09-28 11:12:55	@gage	they used a special box to move it, but even so it did endure interstate trucking
2015-09-28 11:13:23	@gage	luckily they're like 33% of what i paid in 2009
2015-09-28 11:16:32	@bang	iStat looks cool
2015-09-28 11:17:14	@bang	I'm in the same boat. I'm sitting on a $2700 42" plasma...
2015-09-28 11:17:34	@bang	had to mount a tv on my wall. had to be cool

2015-09-28 11:18:07	@gage	she thought it would be too high
2015-09-28 11:18:51	@gage	mine is old enough to have CCD instead of LED backlight
2015-09-28 11:19:15	@gage	i've been telling myself i'd wait until OLED, but that hasn't paid off so far
2015-09-28 11:19:51	@gage	hm LG 55" oled 4k is $2000
2015-09-28 11:20:08	@gage	but LCD is like 500-1000, hard sell

2015-09-28 11:35:02	@bang	I was wondering the same. 4k version of old movies worth it?
2015-09-28 11:36:28	@gage	if they were actually filmed (analog) they it could be pretty good. i have 1080p criterion rips of old kurosawa stuff which look amazing.
2015-09-28 11:37:26	@petong	it is all a plot to sell us more content ;)
2015-09-28 11:47:24	@bang	really? fuck yeah
2015-09-28 11:47:42	@bang	is it only the color stuff?

2015-10-01 10:38:01	theo	anyone setup rsyslog recently? i'm having issues getting the files setup. i see the data coming over but its all going into my /var/log/*.log logs.
2015-10-01 10:38:41	theo	aka: log into client, see auth log update on logging host . anyone had to deal with this?
2015-10-01 10:40:20	theo	didn't you say you were moving to denver?

2015-10-01 11:06:10	@gage	patreon?
2015-10-01 11:06:40	@gage	show us your rsyslog conf
2015-10-01 11:07:06	@gage	insidetrack sounds cool, i think i will apply
2015-10-01 11:07:59	theo	maybe. they send out an email this morning. 
2015-10-01 11:08:22	@petong	sup
2015-10-01 11:11:45	@petong	theo: rsyslog server, you should define a remote ruleset so logs from other servers don't end up in /var/log
2015-10-01 11:12:15	@petong	then apply that ruleset to the listening port
2015-10-01 11:12:26	@petong	input(type="imudp" port="514" ruleset="remote514")
2015-10-01 11:12:34	@petong	like that
2015-10-01 11:12:42	theo	that is what i needed. thanks!
2015-10-01 11:14:24	@petong	the docs are weird, they mix both the old syntax and the new syntax in the examples
2015-10-01 11:14:28	@petong	new syntax is better
2015-10-01 11:21:26	theo	agreed. well, new is a bit confusing. i did not understand why the install shows old syntax and the doc show the new syntax. fucking jerks. ; )

2015-10-02 11:44:24	arclight	It's on my place and 3 other friends' land.
2015-10-02 11:44:33	arclight	Total of about 25 acres near Joshua Tree, CA.
2015-10-02 11:44:51	@gage	nice
2015-10-02 11:45:23	@gage	this sounds fun: You get 5 minutes, one set of traditional drill steels and a 4lb hammer. The goal is to bash a 3/4" hole as deep as you can into a 1,000lb block of solid concrete
2015-10-02 11:46:38	arclight	Yep. I made the steels at the hackerspace. Just need to finish hardening them up tonight. The concrete cube was done 3 weeks ago.
2015-10-02 11:47:19	@gage	how do you harden them? fire?
2015-10-02 11:47:41	@gage	heh, dba excow just fixed a query to take 0.89s instead of 840h
2015-10-02 11:48:51	arclight	Yeah, I bought some O-1 drill rod from McMaster.com. You heat it up red hot with a torch and then quench it in some used motor oil.
2015-10-02 11:49:06	arclight	Also, it gave me an excuse to by a drilling hammer from this place:

2015-10-02 11:49:54	arclight	They sell traditional railroad gang tools.
2015-10-02 11:52:07	@gage	rad
2015-10-02 11:52:20	@gage	i bought a chromed railroad spike the other day at oregon rail heritage center
2015-10-02 11:52:23	@gage	so shiny
2015-10-02 11:54:00	arclight	You're in Portland now. Maybe you should set up your office in the back of a nudie bar, liek Richard Feinman.
2015-10-02 11:54:09	@gage	these hammers remind me of a rumor i heard once that hells angels carry ball peen hammers on their bikes because they can claim it's a tool and not a weapon
2015-10-02 11:54:13	@gage	even though it gets used as the latter
2015-10-02 11:54:34	@gage	yeah really
2015-10-02 11:54:41	@gage	feynmann is my hero
2015-10-02 11:54:46	@gage	there's even a vegan strip club here
2015-10-02 11:54:54	@gage	i don't even
2015-10-02 11:55:50	arclight	A Portland friend explained to me that those places need to have 'X' percentage of revenue come from food sales, so they actively fight to have the best steaks, organic vegan entrees, etc.
2015-10-02 11:56:01	@gage	heh yeah
2015-10-02 11:56:08	@gage	and all bars here are required to serve food
2015-10-02 11:56:11	@gage	it's a great idea
2015-10-02 11:56:14	arclight	He took me to one where old people were all having breakfast and truckers were getting to-go orders.

2015-10-02 12:38:22	@gage	i'm gonna do vagrant + docker 
2015-10-02 12:38:58	@ivanna	they use vagrant + docker for building images for running tests here
2015-10-02 12:39:13	@ivanna	unsure why the vagrant by itself is not good enough
2015-10-02 12:57:47	theo	containers are cool, but i think they will be hard to manage if something goes wrong. the cool part about them is how much less resources you need compared to VMs or bare metal. \m/  
2015-10-02 13:26:24	@petong	I'm not sold on docker
2015-10-02 13:26:43	@petong	maybe for developers but I wouldn't run it in prod

2015-10-05 10:48:43	@gage	hey i have a software question. i want to rewrite some scripts from shell and perl into ruby, using test driven development. i've never written software tests before. where should i start?
2015-10-05 10:49:27	@petong	learn ruby the hard way by zed shaw is a good place to start
2015-10-05 10:49:33	@petong	I think there is a chapter on unit testing
2015-10-05 10:49:45	@petong	http://learnrubythehardway.org/book/ex47.html
2015-10-05 10:49:50	bbrian	I'd look at examples from other people's projects 
2015-10-05 10:49:53	@gage	cool, i'm on exercise 36
2015-10-05 10:50:21	bbrian	it's always easier to take a structure someone else has set up and modify it than it is to make your own (the first time)
2015-10-05 10:50:37	@arclight	As far as space movies, I liked Oblivion. 
2015-10-05 10:50:38	@gage	i just don't know what language or framework to write tests in
2015-10-05 10:50:50	@gage	the only one i've heard of is rspec, but that's ruby specific
2015-10-05 10:50:56	@arclight	Prometheus can eat a big bag of wang.
2015-10-05 10:51:05	@petong	so lame...
2015-10-05 10:51:11	@gage	i avoided prometheus cuz i didn't want to spoil alien
2015-10-05 10:51:15	@gage	hadn't heard of oblivion
2015-10-05 10:51:24	bbrian	gage: I'd use rspec, definitely 
2015-10-05 10:51:37	@gage	but rspec won't test the original scripts i'm converting from
2015-10-05 10:51:49	@gage	i want to write tests that the original passes, then write a ruby script which also passes those tests
2015-10-05 10:52:05	@gage	perhaps i am goign about this the wrong way?
2015-10-05 10:52:13	@gage	it seemed like a logical way to procede
2015-10-05 10:52:18	bbrian	do the scripts have specific inputs and outputs you can test with backticks?  
2015-10-05 10:52:38	@gage	yeah, i suppose they do
2015-10-05 10:53:04	bbrian	env vars, back ticks, maybe you might be able to get somewhere with that.  I think the problem is that there aren'
2015-10-05 10:53:18	bbrian	aren't testing envionments that test across languages 
2015-10-05 10:53:27	bbrian	unless it's inside the JVM or some such 
2015-10-05 10:53:32	@gage	hmm ok. thanks bbrian.
2015-10-05 10:53:49	@gage	in other news, i got docker working as a vagrant provider last night.
2015-10-05 10:54:26	bbrian	that's cool.  We're on heroku which is rather riduculous (IMNSHO) ... everyone keeps talking about docker however.
2015-10-05 10:56:16	@gage	i can see the appeal of heroku from a developer perspective, but from an ops point of view i agree with you

2015-10-05 11:48:41	@ivanna	seems tricky, i'm guessing you wanna have tests that make sure an OS package is installed or something like that? i've only done testing on an application level where i'd unit test a function or a set of functions together
2015-10-05 11:49:18	@ivanna	i think chef and probably puppet has ways of testing to make sure thei recipes run properly, but i'm not sure if you're working within that kind of context for your scripts?

2015-10-14 15:18:17	brianosau	we also need to move off of heroku, make an automated build and release system, have something that spins up and down instances, etc...
2015-10-14 15:18:47	brianosau	basically, build our entire infrastructure as we move off of instacluster and heroku

2015-10-15 10:52:46	theologia	band name ideas.
2015-10-15 10:53:57	brianosau	you could promote with an ifttt recipe to remind people to masturbate 
2015-10-15 11:01:01	@petong	brianosau: have you switched to neovim yet?
2015-10-15 11:03:32	brianosau	neovim?  no.  <googles> ... hmm.  wonder if I'll have to update my vimrc which I've had in some form or another since 2001.
2015-10-15 11:03:54	@petong	I had no compatibility issues
2015-10-15 11:04:02	@petong	just symlink .vimrc -> .nvimrc and try it
2015-10-15 11:04:10	brianosau	this place where I work is full of hardcore vim, tmux, guys
2015-10-15 11:04:11	@petong	I had only one issue with a plugin
2015-10-15 11:04:25	brianosau	ok, I'll give it a go this afternoon.  thanks.  :)

2015-10-15 11:04:36	@petong	^^ my nvimrc ^^
2015-10-15 11:05:08	@petong	brew tap neovim/homebrew-neovim
2015-10-15 11:05:45	brianosau	rainbow parens eh?  doing any clojure?  
2015-10-15 11:05:57	brianosau	this place is full of clojure heads too 
2015-10-15 11:05:58	@petong	was just testing it out ;)
2015-10-15 11:06:38	@petong	Plug is an awesome plugin manager, especially with neovim
2015-10-15 11:07:10	brianosau	hey, what do you use to publish your dotfiles to github  
2015-10-15 11:07:24	brianosau	something I've been meaning to get around to but haven't done
2015-10-15 11:07:48	@petong	I just symlink my dotfiles to my home dir
2015-10-15 11:08:11	@petong	and use pathogen to edit 
2015-10-15 11:08:14	@petong	er, manage
2015-10-15 11:08:27	@petong	I start neovim in my ~/git dir
2015-10-15 11:08:31	@petong	and use Ctrlp
2015-10-15 11:08:36	@petong	+ pathogen
2015-10-15 11:09:00	@petong	but I don't have an automatic way to create all the symlinks
2015-10-15 11:09:35	brianosau	k, one sec.  doing that now. 
2015-10-15 11:09:37	@petong	this is my favorite remap so far:

2015-10-15 11:09:41	@petong	nnoremap <Up> :m-2<CR>==
2015-10-15 11:18:35	brianosau	petong: curious about those ....
2015-10-15 11:18:37	brianosau	https://github.com/brianosaurus/dotfiles
2015-10-15 11:19:00	brianosau	oops
2015-10-15 11:19:15	brianosau	that didn't work quite the way I wanted.  I think I need the symlinks the other way
