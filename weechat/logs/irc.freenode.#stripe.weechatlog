2015-08-27 11:26:38	brianosaurus	The invoice gets paid during the upgrade and we can't add invoice items to it before it gets paid.

2015-08-27 11:29:30	precode	what's up about where i located ?
2015-08-27 11:29:49	markin	precode: though to have a Stripe account you have to be domiciled in a country stripe supports. That's probably why Stripe needs more info (or they'll tell you that Stripe can't support your business)
2015-08-27 11:30:02	@koopajah	brianosaurus: no invoice and then they will be picked up automatically
2015-08-27 11:31:02	bng	Hi. I tried to create a subscription using a specific card. Like this: stripe.customers.createCard(custId, params). Then use the returned card to create a subscription, i.e. stripe.customer.createSubscription(custId, {plan: .., source: card.id})
2015-08-27 11:31:04	brianosaurus	koopajah: thanks. that's very helpful.  trying it now.  
2015-08-27 11:31:15	bng	But I receive this error in the latter call: Error: invalid token card_xx
2015-08-27 11:31:46	markin	bng: a subscription will only ever bill the customer's default card
2015-08-27 11:31:47	bng	You know what's wrong? How to create a subscription for a specific card (as I don't want to use default card in this case)?
2015-08-27 11:32:03	precode	my country is usa
2015-08-27 11:32:11	markin	precode: but you said you're in vietnam?
2015-08-27 11:32:28	precode	but now , i working in vietnam
2015-08-27 11:32:38	bng	markin: so if later customer changes his default card, the subscription will automatically be charged to that new card?
2015-08-27 11:32:45	markin	bng: yes
2015-08-27 11:33:06	bng	markin: my use case is a customer may have multiple subscription and has the option to pick any card. Is it possible to implement this use case at all?
2015-08-27 11:33:24	precode	my nationality is still usa
2015-08-27 11:33:27	markin	bng: you'd need separate customer's per card
2015-08-27 11:34:02	markin	precode: You can find out from support@stripe.com what is needed but for a US stripe account you normally need a US based business (US address, bank account, and US tax id)
2015-08-27 11:34:20	bng	markin: you mean I have to create multiple customers (even for just one user in the system)?
2015-08-27 11:34:40	markin	dboskovic: yes (so you'd have one customer per card basically)

2015-08-27 11:36:15	bng	one more question: if I can't specify a card for a subscription, why is there the `source` param in createSubscription? What is it use for?
2015-08-27 11:36:25	bng	lol, technically 2 questions :)

2015-08-27 11:37:43	markin	bng: its legacy, but the description of source is that it sets the source as the customer's default card and deletes the old default
